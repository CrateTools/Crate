# CRATE V2.0 FOR ☢️NUKE17 COMING SOON

#

Screenshots Soon

Note: Crate V2.0 is a major update both for it´s interface, functions, engines and code. It works very different compared to V1.1., a clean install is needed.

New studio professional tools, Curators vs Visitors access, user read and write privileges, user interface privileges according to role. 

Library objects vs storage tiers it allows to have the thumbnails and animated previews on a separate cache. You might choose to locate the cache over ssd/nvme disk and the raw elements on an array or high capacity disk.

We´re are working to build a first long term solid foundation and allow users to iterate their versions easily.

#

Crate is the first 3D browser for Nuke that generates thumbnails from geometry and gaussian splats automatically for you.

#

No more guesswork, just thumbnails, making it easier than ever to find, organize, and access your 3D resources.
Double-click and the asset will instantly appear in the nodegraph.
Forget about creating cache images in your OS explorer, Crate does everything for you in the background right inside Nuke.

Crate uses F3D, OpenImageIO, FFmpeg, ImageMagik and MediaInfo as splat, geo, data and image engines for fast ingest, still and animated thumbs done automatically on the fly, professional color management, image sequences, data integrity checks, metadata and more.

Our engines will continue to allow Crate to grow into new and more professional features, many of them already on V2.0
