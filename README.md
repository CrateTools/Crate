# 🎬📽️𒄆🎞️ CRATE V2.0 FOR ☢️NUKE17 COMING SOON

Crate is the first 3D browser for Nuke that generates thumbnails from geometry and gaussian splats automatically for you.

#

Supported Formarts: usd, usda, usdc, usdz, abc, splat, spz, ply, fbx, obj, 3ds, wrl, dae, off, x, 3mf, gltf/.glb, pts, xbf, and more.
#

No more guesswork, just thumbnails, making it easier than ever to find, organize, and access your 3D resources.
Double-click and the asset will instantly appear in the nodegraph.
Forget about creating cache images in your OS explorer, Crate does everything for you in the background right inside Nuke.

Crate is a set of Python scripts designed to work with F3D, a fast and minimalist 3D viewer, to provide asset browsing capabilities for splats and geometry in Nuke.

It also uses OpenImageIO, FFmpeg, ImageMagik and MediaInfo as data and image engines for fast ingest, still and animated thumbs done automatically on the fly, professional color management, image sequences, data integrity checks, metadata and more.

Our engines will continue to allow Crate to grow into new and more professional indutry standard features, many of them already on V2.0
